I checked out the three files here and they seem fine. Could be cleaned up, but this is
a never-ending process. I think the comments are clear enough.

wasp_replicator_11.ipynb is what we used to do the main runs.

wasp_replicators_11-single_caste.ipynb was used for the single caste runs mentioned in the paper.

dothegraphics.ipynb was used to generate all of the graphics in the paper. Note that  because of scaling issues we had to reset the graphs often. So, this code does not by itself generate all of the graphics. Instead, it can be modified in fairly obvious ways to do them.
