wasp_replicator_11.ipynb is what we used to do the main runs.

wasp_replicators_11-single_caste.ipynb was used for the single caste runs mentioned in the paper.

dothegraphics.ipynb was used to generate all of the graphics in the paper. Note that  because of scaling issues we had to reset the graphs often. So, this code does not by itself generate all of the graphics. Instead, it can be modified in fairly obvious ways to do them.

outputs.zip is a compressed output file for one series of runs. It is meant as an example of what you get when you run the code. The net size of all of the output files for the work reported in the paper is about 750 megabytes and much too large for GitHub, and indeed, too large to be useful. We recommend simply re-running the code.
